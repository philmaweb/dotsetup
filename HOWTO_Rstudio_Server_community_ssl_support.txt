# For this to work you need to be connected to the same network as the machine you are configuring

# We are assuming a debian based server architecture. The following steps assume you are connected to the Virtual Machine over a ssh session and you have sudo access.

# rstudio-server should already be installed - otherwise follow the steps described on https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download-server/

# install nginx
sudo apt install nginx

# Get a certificate using openssl

sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout /etc/nginx/cert.key -out /etc/nginx/cert.crt

# Edit the configuration

vim /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default

# RStudio server Configuration

# We need to disable simple http access from anywhere in the network, and restrict it to connections only from the same host (rstudio server can only be reached from the same server via nginx)

vim /etc/rstudio/rserver.conf

# paste
www-address=127.0.0.1

# to load the configuration we need to restart rstudio-server
sudo service rstudio-server restart

# Now access your rstudio-server over https at 
https://192.168.81.122

# You probably need to accept warnings and trust the certificate when accessing the server for the first time, as we are using a self-signed certificate not validated by an outside entity. This certificate is also only valid for 365 days, so a new certificate needs to be created each year.
